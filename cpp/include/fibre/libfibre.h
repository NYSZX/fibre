/**
 * @brief Fibre C library
 * 
 * The library is fully asynchronous and runs on an application-managed event
 * loop. This integration happens with the call to libfibre_open(), where the
 * application must pass a couple of functions that libfibre will use to put
 * tasks on the event loop.
 * 
 * Some general things to note:
 *  - None of the library's functions are blocking.
 *  - None of the library's functions can be expected to be thread-safe, they
 *    should not be invoked from any other thread than the one that runs the
 *    event loop.
 *  - Callbacks that the user passes to a libfibre function are always executed
 *    on the event loop thread.
 *  - All of the library's functions can be expected reentry-safe. That means
 *    you can call into any libfibre function from any callback handler that
 *    libfibre invokes.
